      <p class="ParagraphContent"> I am a graduate of Ohio State University with a bachalors or science in computer and information science with
        a specialization in compuer graphics and game design. During high school i took programming classes at a career
        center and continued my education at Ohio State University with a desire to learn more about game development.
        I begin learning game development with Unreal Engine after messing around with OpenGL and Unity for the previous two years.
        I see game development as a medium that brings together creativity with art into a technical medium which i find to be the
        most intriging area of computer science. I have filled my free time with furthering my knowledge in Unreal Engine and
        hope to release my own game someday for the purpose of realizing my own imaginative ideas.</p>
