      This project semester course put students into groups (my group being composed of 5 including me) in order to remake the first dungeon of The Legend of Zelda for the NES using MonoGame. 
      
      While developing the project students were introduced to try and prioritize high cohesion and decoupling among the classes done through adopting different design patterns for the classes of the game.
      
      Throughout the project we utilized an assortment of design patterns to achieve different functionality such as states, commands, factories, and observers to help decouple different classes.
      
      During development some of my responsibilities were sprite sheets, classes, and factories so sprite could be easily created and drawn whether they were animated or not. 
      
      Some projectile classes along with a projectile manager to keep track of drawing and updating created projectiles. 
      
      An observer system so entities could trigger events that other entities can respond to. 
      
      A room loader to load all the rooms from xml files along with logic for transferring between rooms and updating the current room Link is in.
      
      States for some of the gameâ€™s enemies and some for link.

      Besides recreating the original dungeon, we were given an additional sprint to implement anything we wished.
      
      Other group members implemented a rhythm game along with implementing a creepy pasta mode.
      
      I went on to implement an experience system with infinite procedural cave levels. 
      
      These are done using a basic cellular automaton cave generation algorithm along with placement of enemies and a door to the next generated cave.
