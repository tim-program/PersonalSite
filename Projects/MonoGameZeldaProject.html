    <p>-This project semester course put students into groups (my groups being composed of 5 including me) in order to remake the first
      dungeon of the legend of zelda for the NES using MonoGame
      
      -While developing the project student were introduced to try and prioritize high cohesion and decoupling among the class
      done through adopting different design patterns for the class of the game
      
      -throughout the project we would utilize an assortment of design patterns to achieve different functionality
      such as states, commands, factories, and observer to help decouple different classes
      
      -besides recreating the original dungeon we were given an additional sprint to implement anything we'd wish
      
      -one group member implemented a rhythm game along with others implementing a creepy pasta mode.
      -i went on to implement and experience system with infinite procedural levels. which are basically
      a cellular automaton cave with enemy placement and door to the next generated cave.</p>
