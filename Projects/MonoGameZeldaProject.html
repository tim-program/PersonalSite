      This project semester course put students into groups (my group being composed of 5 including me) in order to remake the first
      dungeon of The Legend of Zelda for the NES using MonoGame. 
      
      While developing the project student were introduced to try and prioritize high cohesion and decoupling among the class
      done through adopting different design patterns for the classes of the game.
      
      Throughout the project we utilized an assortment of design patterns to achieve different functionality
      such as states, commands, factories, and observers to help decouple different classes.
      
      During the semester some of my responsibilities were a sprites and sprite factories so sprite could be easily creating and drawn whether they were animated of not. Multiple projectiles along with a projectile manager to keep track of drawing and updating created projectiles. An observer system so entities could trigger events that other entities can respond to. A room loader to load all the rooms from xml files along with logic for transfering between rooms and updating the current room link is in. States for some of the games enemies and some for link.

      Besides recreating the original dungeon we were given an additional sprint to implement anything we wished.
      
      Other group members implemented a rhythm game along with implementing a creepy pasta mode.
      
      I went on to implement an experience system with infinite procedural cave levels. These are
      done using a basic cellular automaton cave generation algorithm along with placement of enemies and a door to the next generated cave.
