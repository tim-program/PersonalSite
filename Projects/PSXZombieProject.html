      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">This project is currently a work in progress. 

        All that is presently available is a blockout of a map along with unmodeled and untextured actors but
        with most of the behavior in places.
      
        Since it is still being worked on this page will most likely be updated or completely changed in the
        future with completed models, updated features, or a change in focus of the project entirely.</p>

        PSX Zombies is mean as a small side project to demonstrate the 
        <a href="../Blogs/UnrealGunSystem.html">gun system</a> I previously developed. 

        The project is a recreation of the Call of Duty: World at War zombies gamemode. 

        It involves the player fighting off waves of zombies within the confines of a somewhat
        small map till the player dies from being overrun with enemies. 

        Most of the mechanics have been recreated except for the perk system, throwables, 
        and upgradable weapons. 

        The graphics style has been changed to a psx style to make it easier to find online assets and 
        create custom animations and models.
      </p>

      <h1 class="PageSubtitle PageText">Gun System</h1>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">This is the <a href="../Blogs/UnrealGunSystem.html">gun system</a> that has 
        already been presented in one of the blogs so this will be more of a brief overview 
        along with additional info on how it communicates with other game systems.

        The intention for this project and other small projects going forward 
        is to primarily develop one or two features which can be reused in other future projects.

        With this project the main feature was this gun system which still has room for improvement
        but has enough to where I am comfortable to move forward with different projects.

        Since this component of the project was not made for this specific project but for various 
        projects going forward, it would need to be decoupled from all of the other actors of the 
        project.

        The only other classes the gun class relies on to help communicate with other actors is the 
        damagable interface to be able to damage other actors and the pickup interface to allow the 
        player to equip the guns.

        The pickup interface does require the gun class to utilize the InventoryComponent as a 
        gateway of communication so the gun can be equipped by the player. 
        </p>


        <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
          The following is a code snippet demonstrating 
          the behavior of the overridden pickup method from the IPickUp interface. </p>
        <pre>
void AGunBase::PickUp(UInventoryComponent* PickUpInventory,APawn* PickUpPawn) {
  GunMesh->SetSimulatePhysics(false);
  GunMesh->SetCollisionProfileName(FName("NoCollision"));
  AGunBase* PreviousWeapon = PickUpInventory->ForcePickUpWeapon(this);
  if (PreviousWeapon) {
    PreviousWeapon->Destroy();
  }
}
        </pre>

        <p class="ParagraphContent PageText"> The code snippet above shows that the gun is simply an actor that attaches to the player 
          when it is equipped.

          One thing that might seem unresonable is dealing with the previously equipped weapon
          within the pickup method. 
          
          Since the only thing that can been equipped is a gun actor of the AGunBase actor class 
          I believed it to be inconsequential as to whether the previously equipped weapon is dealt
          with in the gun class or the inventory class.

          In the end I chose the gun class since that is its current type.

          But if the type of classes that can be equipped is expanded it would be moved to
          the inventory class where it would either destroy the actor or call the Dropped method
          of the IPickUp interface.
        </p>

        <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
          How the gun system actually functions is it utilizes data assets and creates the guns at 
          runtime rather than have an individual blueprint per weapon.

          One data asset contains the model and all the animations so that the visuals of the 
          weapon can be easily swapped when needed.

          The main data asset contains the data asset for the visuals along with all the gun stats 
          such as damage, fire rate, etc.
        </p>

        
      
      

      <h3 class="PageSubtitle PageText">Vendor Actors</h3>
      
      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">Vendor actors are simply actors implementing the PickUp interface 
        and will decrease the player's point amount in their inventory, if they have enough, when they 
        interact with them. 

        Vendors for purchasing ammo and using points to open the door is generally very simple functionality 
        but the vendors that give the player weapons require a bit more logic since none of the weapons are 
        loaded on game start up. 
        
        Since all guns are created using data assets the Unreal Engine Asset Manager 
        can be used to load any data asset into memory asynchronously and then spawn and initialize a gun 
        actor. 
      </p>
      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        The retrieveal and creation of the data assets are split into two different classes.

        One class is an Unreal Engine subsystem connected to the game instance which any class can access 
        to call methods to spawn weapons. 

        The other class is derived from the AssetManager class and deals with invoking the asynchronous 
        loading process for the data assets.
      </p>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        The following is a code snippet taken from one of the vendor actors in the game which deals with 
        giving the player a random weapon. 
        
        
      </p>
      
      <pre>
UXKMFactorySubsystem* Factory = GetGameInstance()->GetSubsystem&lt;UXKMFactorySubsystem&gt;();
Factory->SpawnAndEquipRandomGunAsset(PickUpPawn);
      </pre>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        It first gets the subsystem from the game instance and then calls a method to spawn and equip a 
        weapon.

        Since the loading of the data asset is being done asynchronously the subsystem contains the logic 
        for spawning a new gun of the AGunBase class, initializing it with the loaded data asset, and 
        equipping it on the pawn passed as an argument.

        This does require the pawn to have an inventory actor component so that the newly spawned gun 
        can be passed to the inventory. 

        Shown below is what is called within the UXKMFactorySubsystem class once the method from the 
        previous code snippet is called.
      </p>

      <pre>
UXKMAssetManager::Get().GetRandomGunAsset(this, FName("SpawnAndEquipGunActorCallback"), EquipPawn);
      </pre>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        UXKMAssetManager class, like the AGunBase class, is not coupled to any of the functionality of 
        the PSX Zombies project and can therefore be used along with the AGunBase class in any future 
        project. 
        
        The three things any of the methods do in the UXKMAssetManager class is find a data asset to load, 
        create the function delegate to call once loading is done, and then invoke the asynchronous loading 
        process.

        Once loading is done the delegate will be invoked and the subsystem class will continue with spawning, 
        initializing, and equipping the weapon.
      </p>
      
      <h1 class="PageSubtitle PageText">Zombie AI</h1>

      <img src="../images/PSXZombies_AITree.png"  alt="Zombies Behavior Tree Visual" class="img"/>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        The image above is the simple zombie ai created with a behavior tree. 

        The first left most sequence deals with some basic initialization including moving to a barrier 
        once it has spawned and getting the players location.

        On the right is a selector with two sequence below it that deal with the basic as logic.

        The sequence on the left of the selector deals with attacking barriers if a zombie is ever 
        in front of one.

        Then the final sequence on the right handles the logic of the zombie chasing and attacking the player.
      </p>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        Although the AI was simple enough since the zombies always have the location of the player stored 
        in them, there was a problem to solve with barriers blocking their path. 

        In the original World at War gamemode all zombies spawn outside the map and must tear down 
        barriers before they can enter. 

        These are meant to clearly indicate to the player where zombies will spawn
        
        They also serve as buffer room buffer room for the players to kill the zombies while the are 
        destroying the barriers to prevent them from entering the map.

        My original solution was to make the barreriers collidible with the player and overlap with 
        the zombies.

        This would allow zombies to enter the map since they wouldn't interfere with the navmesh. 
        
        while preventing the player from exiting the map.

        The Only problem with this was the zombies could still exit the map through the barriers creating 
        some odd behavior when the AI trys to take the most efficient path.
      </p>

      <p class="ParagraphContent PageText">
        Solving this problem ended up being relatively simple with the use of a Nav Link Proxy.

        A one way Nav Link Proxy would create a link between two points on a navmesh that an AI
        agent would be able to traverse even if there is not connection between the points on the navmesh.

        In order to get this working under the specific circumstances of the map a child actor would need 
        to be create of the Nav Link Proxy class.

        With this the nav link proxy actor is able to run any needed custom behavior one the barrier 
        associated with the nav link is destoryed and a zombie tries to traverse the link.

        This would not only enable a zombie to enter the map even if their is not navmesh path into it but 
        also keep them in the map since the nav links can be made to act as a one way path.
