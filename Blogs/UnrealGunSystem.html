      When first making the gun system I used a basic object oriented approach with a parent gun class and an assortment of child gun classes based on varied functionality.
      Progressing through development I would realize this approach would become difficult with overlapping functionality in some weapons.
      If I want to add and automatic weapon I would create a child class but then If I wanted to distinguish between a hitscan weapon and projectile weapons there would be two different automatic weapon classes.
      I began to realize how undesirable a chain of object oriented classes would become with its increasing difficult to manage and add changes.

      The following is a simple and flexible gun system made in Unreal Engine using c++
      I wanted to start a long term project that wanted to be within the FPS medium
      -approach was to create a fleshed out portion, demo on website blog, realized approach would was not the best
      -put current fps portion on blog for sake of not letting time be wasted
      -continue with prototype puzzle pieces that fit togehter

      when first making the gun system i used basic object oriented principles with a gun base
      -comprised of basic functional methods such as shot reload and aim
      -for automatic and burst fire weapons separate classes would be created
      -thought of other child classes
      -pump action might need another separate class
      -if want weapons to shot projectiles instead of hitscan would i then need hitscan and projectile weapon
      classes and then create child gun type classes from them
      -realized how undesirable a chain of object oriented class is and redesigned the gun system to be more flexible

      Needed to have variety of weapons with different functionality but each separate gun functionality is decoupled from each other

      -Comopnents: reciever, Magazine, and projectile
      -reciever used for gun firing,passed fire delegate in base gun class

        GunReciever->TriggerPulled(GunFireDelegate)

      -projectile called from gun fire delegate

        GunProjectile->FireProjectile()

      -gun magazine is used throughout gun base where necessary for ammo checks, manages ammo

      -when doing the creation proecess fron the gun data stored in data table found it difficult to manage references to it
      -found unreal Data Assets and asset manager
      -switch from data table to Data Assets
      -had Data Asset for all gun animation and model relevant data, main Data Asset to hold anim data and component/stat data

      -approach allows to store unchanging data related to a specific gun inside its gun Data Asset 
      -then able to remove all gun data variables and just have one ref of gun Data Asset which can be shared by mutiple actors of same gun
      -very much like flyweight, helps conserve RAM

        GunFactory->SpawnGun(GunDataAsset)

      "

      process (outline 1)
      -start OOP
      -switch to components (components)
      -store relavent data in Data Assets (data driven?)
      -separate Data Assets for gun anims
      -Unreal subsystem gun factory (factory)
      -custom console to spawn guns with factory since gun Data Assets are in asset manager 
        -actually using spawn actor to create gun in console currently (maybe change)
      -custom player movement component for movement states
      
      -maybe demo addition of new weapon
