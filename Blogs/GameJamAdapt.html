        This is a small game done for a 5 day game jam with adaptation as the theme. 
        
        This was the first game jam i decided to use Unreal Engine after learning how to use the engine over the preceding months. 
        
        It is meant to be a rogue-lite where the player's death increases certain stats as the player explores levels of a dungeon with increase difficulty per level. 
        
        To help with fast iteration it was done fully in blueprint with all models, sounds, effects and the dungeon level being taken from the Unreal assert store. 
        
        The gun system was taken from an online tutorial with a custom barrel heat up material and niagara bullet effect added.
        
        Enemies were based of a parent enemy blueprint class to encapsulate basic functionality which allowed for enemies to share a common behavior tree for AI.

        First completed project in Unreal Engine after learning the basics of the available tools in the engine.
