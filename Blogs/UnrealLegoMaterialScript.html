        This small project was originally inspired by another YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HELDYdr5i4Q&ab_channel=NicolasBrack">video</a>. 


        I wanted to try and recreate the realistic rendering that was being done with the Legos in the YouTube video.
        
        First, I found the <a href="https://www.mecabricks.com/">website</a> where the models were retrieved from which enabled me to download different models and import them into Unreal Engine.
        
        I originally thought the material on the Lego bricks from the video was being accomplished by baking a procedural blender shader that was included on the website.
        
        This was unrealistic since each Lego brick was its own individual mesh with a local offset from the origin that coincided to its location on the Lego set.
        
        I tried joining all the bricks together into a single mesh in blender but there were complications that prevented it from being a viable solution.
        
        When approaching the problem from inside Unreal Engine the problem became more complicated since each individual brick had its own material regardless as to whether they shared colors with other bricks.
        
        There could also be thousands of bricks at a time depending on the Lego set.
        
        I knew I needed to have a master material for the imperfections and then instances which could adjust the material's color based on a parameter, but I also could not do this manually with thousands of static meshes.
        
        After some more researching I remembered hearing about Unreal Engines python API that could be used to automate some processes.
        
        I used the Unreal Engine python API to create a collection of all the materials of selected static meshes, create a material instance of an imperfection material, set the material instance base color or texture based on the materials in the collection and then set the newly created material to the associated static mesh.
        
        This script would allow me to import any mesh I wanted from the website and then give it imperfections in seconds by running a single script.
        
        Looking back on the script it seems I used the property matrix to change the multiple uses of different materials of the same color into a single material.
        
        Although, this could easily be done with a separate python script and then these two scripts could be run one after another.
