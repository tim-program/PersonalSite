      In a recent Unreal Engine project of mine i wanted to try utilizing quadtrees and found that unreal engine has some available octree data types.

      Although the resources i found for implementing octrees were for the previous depricated version. 

      Creation of the octree datatype in the header file is identical to the depricated version.

      When working with the TOctree2 in order to iterate through the elements and nodes, lambdas are past as arguments to functions which iterate through the octree.

      One lambda is a predicate to indicate what nodes/elements to work with and a second lambda which operates on the nodes/elements.

      I've never made an octree myself but a variable called LoosenessDenominator exists within the FOctreeNodeContext class.

      This extends octree nodes past there exact extents (provide picture of comparison) and increasing the variable past its default value of 16 improves the tightness of the octree nodes
      
      Quickest way i found to change this was by manually editing GenericOctree.h where it is located and rebuilding
